## A Description of application/website idea 
A traveling app/website for travelers choose appropriate home and restaurant based on airbnb and yelp datasets. For people prefer a certain kind of flavor and want to select a place to live nearby that kind of restaurant, or people already know where to go and want to select an airbnb together with the consideration on restaurants.

A user inputs a certain flavor or kind of restaurant, the website will return the high density area of that kind of restaurant in the city. Then recommend high rank airbnb in that area.
After a user selects an airbnb by price, then the website will recommend certain kind of restaurant in that area.


## How to run the app locally?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
